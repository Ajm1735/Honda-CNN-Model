This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of five Honda car models: the Civic, Odyssey, CR-V, Element, and Ridgeline. All images were manually collected from the web and organized into training, validation, and testing sets. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras and is designed to run easily in Google Colab so that anyone can reproduce the results without needing a local development environment.

Because the dataset is too large for GitHub’s standard upload limits, the complete image set is hosted as a Release asset. To run the notebook, download the ZIP file named OD.CIV.HRV.RIDGELINE.ELEMENT.FINAL.zip from the project’s Release page. When you open the notebook in Google Colab, it will prompt you to upload this ZIP file. After uploading, the notebook automatically extracts the dataset and creates the necessary data/train, data/val, and data/test folders inside the Colab workspace. No manual file setup is required once the ZIP is uploaded.

After the dataset is prepared, you can run the entire notebook from top to bottom. The code handles preprocessing, data augmentation, model building, training, and evaluation. The CNN architecture consists of standard convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by dense layers and a softmax output for five-class prediction. When training completes, the notebook displays accuracy, loss curves, and model performance metrics, allowing you to evaluate how well the model distinguishes between the different Honda vehicles.

This repository contains the main Jupyter Notebook used for training and evaluation, along with instructions for setting up the dataset in Google Colab. The project was created by Aiden Michael (Ajm1735) for ISAT 449 using a manually built dataset of Honda vehicle images.
